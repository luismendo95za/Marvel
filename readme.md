CODE STYLE 

I try to space the code with the rules that I have learned from swiftlint, I apply short and concise names for the names of the methods and variables. I try to ensure that the files are not very long and that the lines of code are not too long.

Architecture: VIPER 

VIPER's architecture has 5 parts and is based on the Single Responsibility Principle that provides you with smooth and clean functionality.
It makes the process scalable and allows developers to work simultaneously on a project.
Segment the different applications based on their functions and distribute responsibilities.
New features can be easily added, such as automated test writing.

COCOAPODS

It is a dependency manager for Xcode, as its page indicates, and in simple words it allows us to add frameworks to our projects, keep them updated using a single command.
